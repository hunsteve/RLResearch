XTreeCSharp
===========

This is a C# implementation of the [X-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-tree) space partitioning tree structure.

The implementation is based on the original C++ implementation by Hans-Peter Kriegel group @Munich: [xtree.tar.gz](https://chorochronos.datastories.org/?q=node/46).
